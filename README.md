# NOTE TAKER APP
The note taker app is a simple program that allows the user to create custom notes, and save them for later reference. It uses a variety of technologies to provide an interactive UI.

## Installation Instructions
To use locally on your machine please follow the directions below:

    - Clone the repo from https://github.com/skvisual/NoteTakerApp
    - Open the folder in your favorite code editor
    - Select the server.js file and open in terminal
    - Install all dependencies

    - In your terminal window run the command 'node server.js'
    - Once the server is live, open your favorite web browser.
    - Go to localhost:8080
    - You can now freely use the application as you please

The application is also available on Heroku by visiting https://stormy-hollows-97670.herokuapp.com/
**NOTE: SEE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS BELOW**

## Future Developments
4/3/20 - In its current state the application is unable to recall previously saved notes. I hope to add this feature in the near future. I would like to add some text formatting options as well for added customization.
